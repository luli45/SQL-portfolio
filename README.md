This is a repository I created to share on some projects I have done as part of my portfolio. I performed data cleaning and manipulation on the Nashville housing market. The data and guide for the project was provided by AlexTheAnalyst.
I also did a case study as part of the Google Data Analytics Certificate by Coursera. I shared the SQL code I did in MySQL Workbench. 
I am sharing here the file to the case study.
